# Printer Emulator

## Description
This is a ZPL command line emulation tool. This allows you to quickly preview ZPL labels without having to print and waste labels during label design.
This uses the publicly available APIs at http://labelary.com.

This will create a png sample of your label at the location that you ran the emulation tool.
